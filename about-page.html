            A webpage focusing on extinct animals may seem rather strange, but
            can be important for understanding the importance of a well balanced
            ecosystem. This site is dedicated to exploring the legacy of the
            dodo bird, one of history’s most iconic extinct animals. The dodo's
            story is a powerful reminder of how human impact can alter the
            course of nature. By studying a species who went extinct nearly 400
            years ago, we gain important insight into the fragile balance of the
            ecosystem, and learn how we can preserve endangered animals today.
            Understanding extinction helps us to prevent it from repeating. Join
            us in honoring the past to safeguard the future.

                    The Dodo bird's extinction is a reminder that discovery
                    without responsibility can lead to destruction.

                    I got involved because I wanted to make learning about the
                    dodo fun. Along the way, I discovered all kinds of cool
                    facts, like how Kevin from "Up" was a dodo, and I never
                    knew!

                    I always thought of the Dodo Bird as a bit of a joke growing
                    up. Getting to learn more about it allows me to see it in a
                    new light!
